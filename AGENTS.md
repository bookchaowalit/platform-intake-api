# Agent Instructions

- Human-facing replies are in Thai by default; keep code, commands and identifiers as-is.
- Never print, commit or copy secrets: database URLs, tokens and keys live in Railway
  variables and `~/.config/solo-intake/` (owner-only).
- Tests use a throwaway local PostgreSQL and a fake platform; they must never reach
  the hosted database or the hosted platform.
- Run `.venv/bin/pytest -q` before committing. Migrations are append-only: never edit
  an applied file, add a new numbered one.
- `src/cellkit` is this repository's own service code (first generated from `cell.yaml`; the shared
  generator was retired on 2026-10-12). Change it here; there is nothing upstream to sync from.
  Cell-specific code lives in `src/solo_intake/`.
- `intake-mcp` (stdio, see `.mcp.json`) is this cell's MCP server: tools `intake.<resource>.list|get|create|update|delete`
  call the cell API with the caller's token (`EMPIRE_TOKEN`, `EMPIRE_TOKEN_FILE` or the `owner-mcp` automation token;
  URL from `EMPIRE_INTAKE_API`). Set `EMPIRE_MCP_READONLY=1` for list/get only. Never add actor, workspace or token arguments.
- Merging to `main` deploys production (Railway GitHub source + Wait for CI); verify `/health`
  and one authorized read afterwards. Do not `railway up` from a working tree.
- Keep the solo-empire registry entry (`intake` in
  `repository-catalog/registries/online-systems.yaml`) in sync.
